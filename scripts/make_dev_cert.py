"""Generate a self-signed TLS certificate for LAN access.

Why this exists: a browser only exposes a device camera on a *secure* origin.
`http://localhost` counts as secure, but `http://192.168.x.x` - which is what a
phone must use to reach this machine - does not. So the phone-camera page is
unreachable over plain HTTP on a LAN, and the server needs TLS.

The certificate is self-signed, so the phone shows a warning the first time and
the operator accepts it once. That is fine for a local deployment on a closed
network and is not a substitute for a real certificate in production.

Usage:
    python scripts/make_dev_cert.py
    uvicorn backend.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8443 \
        --ssl-keyfile certs/dev-key.pem --ssl-certfile certs/dev-cert.pem

Then open https://<this-machine-ip>:8443/api/live/siren on the phone.

Note that binding 0.0.0.0 exposes the API to everything on the network. The API
has no authentication yet, so only do this on a network you control.
