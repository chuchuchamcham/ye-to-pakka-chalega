"""Shared video engine: reading, frame sampling, timestamps, metrics.

Every module pipeline (person_id, anpr, zone, behavior, lowlight) reads
frames through VideoReader and writes the annotated result through
core.output.OutputVideoWriter, instead of touching cv2.VideoCapture /
cv2.VideoWriter directly. This keeps codec fallback, FPS/duration handling,
and processing metrics in one place.

Two readers live here, and the difference is finiteness, not file format:

  VideoReader      - a finite uploaded file. Iteration ends at the last
                     frame, frame_count/duration are known up front, and a
                     read failure is fatal. Used by Forensic Mode.
  LiveStreamReader - a continuous camera (RTSP) or a looping local file
                     standing in for one. Iteration never ends on its own,
                     duration is unknown, and a read failure is a
                     *reconnect*, not an error. Used by Live Mode.

    Accepts an RTSP/HTTP camera URL, or a local file path with `loop=True` so

    demos - the same code path either way, so nothing changes when a real
    border-post camera replaces the stand-in.

    Three things make this different from VideoReader, and all three are
    required for continuous operation rather than being nice-to-haves:

    1. A failed read is not the end of the stream. Cameras drop, networks
       blip, cables get kicked. The iterator marks itself RECONNECTING, backs
       off, reopens, and carries on; only an explicit stop() ends iteration.
       Callers therefore never need try/except around a camera going away.
    2. Timestamps are wall-clock elapsed, not frame_index/fps. Across a
       reconnect or a loop restart there is no continuous frame counter to
       divide, and every downstream rule (zone dwell, loitering windows,
       behaviour cooldowns) reasons in seconds - so those seconds have to be
       real elapsed time, or a reconnect would silently rewind them.
    3. File sources are paced to their own FPS. Without that, a local stand-in
       file is decoded as fast as the CPU allows, which both misrepresents
       live throughput and makes every time-based rule fire at the wrong rate.
       Real RTSP is paced by the network and needs no help.
