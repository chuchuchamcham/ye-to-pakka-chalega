"""Live camera registry and per-camera capture sessions.

This is the live counterpart to backend.api.jobs.JobManager. The difference
is the lifecycle: a job is created, runs to completion and is *done*, whereas
a camera session is started and then simply runs - there is no terminal
success state, only online/reconnecting/offline and an eventual explicit
stop. Modelling a camera as a job was the thing that made "live" impossible
in the Forensic Mode design, so it is deliberately not reused here.

One session owns one capture thread. Frames are JPEG-encoded once per frame
inside that thread and handed to every viewer, rather than each viewer
encoding independently - with several operators watching the same camera,
per-viewer encoding is the difference between one encode per frame and N.

    separates real movement from detector jitter.

    Live analysis on CPU runs at roughly 3-6fps, which breaks those
    assumptions in a specific way: consecutive observations are ~0.25s and
    tens of pixels apart, so *every* frame clears an 8px floor and becomes a
    new movement segment, and any tracker wobble between two distant
    observations reads as a direction reversal. Measured on a sparse test
    clip, the file-tuned defaults produced ~120 behaviour events in 30
    seconds - which is noise, not intelligence, and an alert stream nobody can
    act on is worse than none.

    These values restore the intent by spanning a longer baseline per segment

    and vote_min_observations agreeing reads is an easy bar to clear.

    Live analysis already drops frames to stay in step with the wall clock,
