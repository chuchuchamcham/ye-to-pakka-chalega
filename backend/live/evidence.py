"""Evidence capture for live alerts: snapshot, surrounding clip, metadata.

An alert without evidence is an assertion. For a security record to be worth
anything afterwards - in a review, a handover, or an inquiry - someone has to
be able to see what the system saw when it decided.

The hard part of live evidence is that the interesting moment has already
happened by the time the rule fires: a zone intrusion is only knowable once
someone is inside. So frames are kept in a short rolling buffer and the clip
is assembled from *before* the event plus a tail recorded after it, giving the
approach as well as the act.

Frames are buffered as encoded JPEGs, not raw arrays. The session already
encodes every frame for the live view, so buffering costs nothing extra and
uses roughly 10MB per camera instead of the ~190MB the same window of raw
960x540 frames would take.
