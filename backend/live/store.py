"""Durable, tamper-evident event store.

Two problems solved together, because they are the same problem.

*Persistence*: events lived only in memory, so a restart erased the record
while the evidence clips it referred to stayed on disk. A security log that
forgets is not a log.

*Tamper-evidence*: a stored log that anyone can quietly edit proves nothing
afterwards. Each row therefore carries the hash of the row before it, so the
whole history forms a chain: changing, inserting or deleting any record breaks
every hash after it, and the break is detectable without a trusted third
party.

This is deliberately not a blockchain. There is no network, no consensus and
no token - those solve mutual distrust between organisations, which is not the
situation here. The property actually needed is "nobody can alter the record
without it being obvious", and a hash chain gives exactly that. A permissioned
ledger can be layered on later if a deployment ever needs several parties to
distrust each other's copies.

Writes happen on a background thread. An analysis thread must never wait on a
disk flush to report that someone crossed a fence.
