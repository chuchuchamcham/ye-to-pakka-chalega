"""Live camera sessions fed by a pushed source (a phone acting as a camera).

These cover the failure that made a working phone camera look broken: the
session kept dropping offline - sounding the siren and filling the evidence
panel each time - while the phone was still transmitting normally. Every check
here is about the seam between a long-lived sending socket and a session that
replaces its reader whenever it restarts.
