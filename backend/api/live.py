"""Live camera HTTP API: registration, control, health and video streaming.

Video reaches the browser as multipart MJPEG rather than a finished MP4. That
is the whole point of Live Mode: Forensic Mode can only show you a result
after the job completes, because the thing it produces *is* a file. An MJPEG
response is an open connection the server keeps appending frames to, so the
operator sees the current frame, not a finished artifact.

MJPEG (over WebRTC) is a deliberate trade: it renders in a plain <img> tag
with no player library, no signalling and no codec negotiation, which is what
makes it viable to build and demo reliably. WebRTC would cut bandwidth and
latency further and is the natural upgrade once the rest is stable.
